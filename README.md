## What is this?

This simple tool will check if any of your runescape accounts are alive
by making a lookup on runescape's highscores. 

There are some cases to cover if your accounts doesn't up:

- Permanently banned
- Locked

That means even if your account has a 2-day ban, it will show up and you
will be able to use them again.

## How to use

In the project directory you will find 2 .txt files:

- account_input.txt
- account_output.txt

You simply write the account names in the __**account_input.txt**__ file
that you want checked, in the following format:

```
name1
name2
name3
name4
```
and then you can run it via the run button or in the terminal by 
executing the following command:

`python main.py`
